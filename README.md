## Project description 

Landing page for a MDS stock exchange platform created for internship purposes. Page was desinged using MDS official website as an example and some of the assets such as logo and colors were copied for consistency in design. The page was made responsive so it works on all devices. Media on the page was compressed using [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/) software to reduce file size. The site is also published on [GitHub Pages](https://miske11.github.io/mds-stock-exchange-landing-page/) for easier preview.  
  
Main parts of the page are the following:
- Navbar
- Header
- About Us
- Services
- Contact Us
- Footer

### Navbar
Navbar was made so that there is a company logo on the left side and navigation links on the right side. All links lead to a corresponding part of the page. If the screen shrinks enough in width, navigation links become a burger menu that when pressed shows the links below. This was made so that the website could be viewed on mobile devices and in smaller resolution.

### Header
Header consists of two parts. Mission statement on the right and call to action on the left. Call to action part has a button that doesn't do anything for now, but was made to show how the site would look like if it was functional. The background of the header plays a looping video that was initialy 30mb in size but was made smaller by compressing it to 480p to improve page performance.

### About Us
This is a simple section made to show company mission, vision and some more information about the company. Images used are also compressed so that they would load faster. Lazy loading was also used to further image loading performance and reduce resources used.

### Services
This section shows the services that the stock exchange platform is offering. It consists of simple cards that were made using grid which makes them responsive so they fill up space that is left. Each card represents one service.

### Contact Us 
This section provides company contact info that includes phone number, email and social media links. It also includes a form which allows users to enter their information and contact the company directly by sending a message. It also includes form validation such as checking if all fields were filled or the right information was provided.

### Footer
Footer is minimalistic and contains some policy info, social media links and page links.
